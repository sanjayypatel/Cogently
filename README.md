# Cogently

## Abstract

An executive summary application that allows staff members to upload pdf files, add tags and summary text, add inline notes or talking points to the file.  The executive or "manager" account will be able to log into a streamlined feed of file names with associated summaries, notes and download links.  The primary function of the application is to allow manager accounts to quickly familiarize themselves with large or complex documents via the summarizing and highlights of their staff.
